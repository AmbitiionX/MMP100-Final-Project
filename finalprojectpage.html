<h1>Yashin's Daily Training</h1>
<p>Yashin believes in training both the body and the spirit. Why can't that be fun though? Here I tried to animate Yashin doing some of his daily training and messing around a bit by flipping his sword before ultimately cutting the rock.</p>

<p>Artistically, the inspiration for this final project came more from a desire for simplicity than anything else. I wanted to keep the execution of it all as feasible as possible. As such, I decided upon a simple animation of my character going about some training with a sword and a rock. 
	Details in the photoshopped image are meant to portray the aesthetic of the realm that he lives in with the pink sky, visible hut and eagles in the background. The sword flip that the character does is meant to illustrate his fun-loving nature as he finds the time to do so even though he is training. 
	The project was done in the format of an animated short. Some techniques I used in order to execute the final product is masking in Photoshop and the use of Keyframes in After Effects. 
	From the conceptualization of the Animation through a storyboard to the final product, I cannot say that much had changed. Lowering the risk factor meant I wanted to keep the animation as simple as possible, so a small flip of the sword before going through the rock was always what I aimed for.
