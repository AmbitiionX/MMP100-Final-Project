<h1>Enter: Yashin</h1> 
	<p>The name of my character is Yashin. An amicable fellow, Yashin can easily be spotted in a crowd thanks to his distinctive head of purple hair. Known for cracking a joke or two, Yashin is not to be taken lightly where battle is concerned. His weapons of choice; his two swords, Heaven and Earth.</p>
